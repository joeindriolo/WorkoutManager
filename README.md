# WorkoutManager

The WorkoutManager is meant to keep track of workout information. It is my solution to being more organized about my workouts. Whenever you workout, you can add your exercises into the software and it is stored in a database.
At any point, you can go back and look at previous workouts in a list view or calendar. The software also saves the exercise types for convenience. 

Future plans:

Exercise Presets
